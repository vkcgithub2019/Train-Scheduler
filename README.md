# Train-Scheduler
This assigment uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and jquery to create a webpage to display train schedules. Firebase is used to host arrival and departure data. To retrieve and manipulate information, moment.js is used. This website provides real-time information about various trains with regards to their arrival times, and how many minutes remain until the trains arrive at their station. The "minutes away" time will refresh every minute.
